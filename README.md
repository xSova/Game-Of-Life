## What's this?

This is Conway's Game of Life.

## How's it work?

There are four rules:
- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
